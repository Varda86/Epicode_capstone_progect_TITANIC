# Epicode_capstone_progect_TITANIC
 Data analysis of a dataset containing informations about the passengers and the crew of Titanic


 The aim of the project is:
    1) to clean data and to do some EDA on the dataset
    2) to do some simple Correlation Analysis
    3) to reconstruct the families that sailed on the Titanic

This project is based on a dataset in CSV format, found in the website "koggle.com". In this web site the file is used in a competition to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. For this reason the data are already quite clean and ready to be used for my Data Analysis.

To clean and analyze the dataset I have used Python, especially Pandas library. I've also made some very simple charts using Matplotlib library.
Then I've made a Report to display what I've discovered thanks to my analysis. I've decided do make the same report twice, using two different softwares: Google LookerSdutio and Power B.I.. I've used Looker because it's simple to use and open source, so there is no need to buy a license to visualize my report. I've used Power B.I. because it's much morepowerful, expecially thanks to the Dax and the data processing (Looker gave me so many problems even to do some small modification to the dataset, or to add a simple calculated field).

In this repository there are: the CSV file containing the Dataset; a Jupiter file containing my Data Analysis and at the end of it I've inserted the links to open the two reports.

HAVE FUN!!
